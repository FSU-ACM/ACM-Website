We are happy to introduce the first (and final?) snapshot of Minecraft 1.11.1!!!!11oneone! This patch is mainly focused on fixing more bugs, but also contains a number of minor features just in time for the Holidays. In particular, there is a new use for the fireworks, but remember to be careful when handling explosives.

There is also a new (potentially controversial) change to the combat mechanics. Without revealing what it is, you will most definitely notice the difference when you try out the snapshot. We anticipate much feedback.

Continuing on the combat system, there is a new sword enchantment, and Mending is no longer compatible with Infinity on bows.

And finally, you can now recycle many tools and items in the furnace. The reward is minuscule but considerably better than nothing!
