# About

Mojang AB is a games studio based in Stockholm, Sweden.

We were founded in 2009 by Markus “Notch” Persson. He’s also the creator of our best-selling game to date: Minecraft. Since then, we’ve released our second game, the card-collecting tactical battler Scrolls, and have dabbled in publishing with Oxeye Game Studio’s awesome side-scrolling robo-blaster Cobalt. We’re developing more games, too, but we’re not ready to talk about those quite yet.

In 2014, Mojang was bought by Microsoft. The acquisition hasn’t changed much about our company - we still release and support our games on multiple platforms, including iOS, Playstation and more, as well as Windows and Xbox. We plan to keep our independent spirit and we’ll continue to treat our community with the respect and honesty it deserves.
