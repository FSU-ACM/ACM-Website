We are excited to announce that registration for the Spring Programming Contest is now live! You can find registration [here](http://springprogrammingcontest.com/preregister) or by using the link in our navbar.

By preregistering, you will receive an email when full registrtion goes up, plus a spot will be reserved for you if we max out our attendance capacity (which may happen this year!).

Hope to see you there!
