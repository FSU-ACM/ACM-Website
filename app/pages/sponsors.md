title: Sponsors

ACM at FSU is funded through private sponsors. Many of our events and gatherings are catered and sponsored by generous donors from local, regional, and even international companies. Thanks to their support our members can enjoy competing in Programming Contests, attending talks by industry leaders, and access to helpful resources.
